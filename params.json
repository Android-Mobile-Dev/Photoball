  "body": "### App Description\r\nThis app will take images of line drawings from the device’s camera and generate a map based on that picture. Afterwards, a simulator of a ball bouncing through the environment will run which shows that the ball interacts with the generated environment. There will be a selection of base images to choose from.\r\nThe purpose of the app is to utilize user creativity for unlimited content. The premise of map generation can be later used in future apps. The chance of success is medium to high because it is a simple enough concept for easy entertainment without being too complicated for users.\r\n\r\n### List of Features\r\n    .
