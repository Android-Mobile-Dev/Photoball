2. Brief Instructions:
	When the app is first launch, there is three buttons on the home screen that visualized the three ways of starting animation in PhotoBall.
	Once the app is launched, press the camera button to take a picture in the app. Once you are on the camera screen, you can rotate the picture with the left button. Pressing the center button will take the picture, and you can either press the back button on the left to go back or the check button to confirm the photo. If you want to take a picture from your library, press the + button on the main screen in order to select a photo from your library. The play button chooses allows the user to choose an image from the Photoball image library without having to detect the edges again. After an image is selected, the user will be able to place the ball and press "Start".

		Note: ModifyImage method is based on sample in library and StackOverflow help with the library and things such as bitmap compression and file manipulation.
		Also, the link below helped us to find out how to do proper collision in terms of
		adjusting the bitmap's getPixel method relative to a ratio with ImageView:
